# mineral-water-delivery.github.io
This project aims to simplify the process of managing a mineral water delivery system by creating a user-friendly software solution that can streamline the entire process, from managing orders to deliveries. The proposed system will allow customers to place orders online. Meanwhile, the system will allow the water delivery company to manage its inventory and track its delivery personnel.

The method the suppliers go for managing the database about the customers is a handwritten register which is manually managed. The database contains information like customer name, customer address, days on which the customer made the payment, customer dues, amount the customer paid, and many more.

Managing all this data manually is a hard task and updating it can be tiring. When the suppliers want an updated report at the end of the week or month they have to manually go through each record. Basically, there is no shortcut to it. 

For a good business, these suppliers need these reports. The reports can be of the due amount of customers, the average number of bottles a customer consumes per month, and the average number of bottles supplied per day. These reports a supplier needs to extend their business and make it more profitable. 

To solve this problem, the solution is to develop an interface that will allow suppliers to enter the data easily, sort those data easily, and most important where a supplier can generate and store reports easily, just by doing some clicks.

The main objectives of this project will be:

To develop an interface that allows suppliers to manage customers and data easily.
 It will allow suppliers to generate different reports easily.
It will allow customers to order a delivery.
Customers can check their personal data like the last payment date and payment amount.
A separate screen will provide information about the supplier.
